        	<h2>Tourist Information</h2>
        	<p>Visiting the world famous Golden Gate Bridge is a unique experience for everyone. Whether you hike, walk, bike, shop, take a guided tour, or just sit back and take it all in, there is something for everyone.

             ggb-visitor-center

             The Bridge's Welcome Center offers merchandise and historical information. Open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., the Welcome Center is the first on-site center dedicated to telling the stories of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Center welcomes visitors, provides orientation and information services, houses exhibits, and offers high-quality commemorative and interpretive merchandise, and also showcases the original 12-foot stainless steel Bridge "test tower" used in 1933. Be sure to also check out the Golden Gate Parks Conservancy online store for one-of-a-kind gifts and collectibles. Contact the Welcome Center at 415-426-5220 or customerservice@goldengatebridgestore.org.

             Onsite Exhibits
             Learn about the history, science, and engineering of the Bridge's construction through interactive and stationery exhibits. Wander through the Plaza just outside the Welcome Center and follow the pathway into an old bunker that houses some of the exhibits.
